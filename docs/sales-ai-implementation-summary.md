## 3. Current AI Capabilities (Mock Responses)

The Sales AI currently responds to questions using keyword matching and returns content from the knowledge base.

### Supported Question Types:

1. **Discovery Questions**
   - Keywords: "discovery", "qualification", "what questions", "ask in", "BANT"
   - Returns: Opening questions, current state assessment, pain points, compliance, budget discovery, decision process

2. **Pricing Objections**
   - Keywords: "pricing/price/expensive/cost" + "objection/handle/respond"
   - Returns: LAER framework, apples-to-apples comparison, TCO approach, case study examples

3. **Service Tiers**
   - Keywords: "tier", "IT360", "IT Assist", "IT Essentials", "difference between", "compare", "which service"
   - Returns: Complete tier breakdown with pricing, features, positioning tips, add-ons

4. **General Objections**
   - Keywords: "objection", "think about it", "too small", "internal IT", "LAER"
   - Returns: Common objections with LAER responses

5. **General Help**
   - Default response: Overview of available knowledge with example questions

### Example Questions That Work:

✅ "What questions should I ask in a discovery call?"
✅ "How do we handle pricing objections?"
✅ "What's included in IT360 vs IT Assist?"
✅ "How do I respond to 'you're too expensive'?"
✅ "What are the service tiers?"
✅ "Tell me about BANT qualification"
✅ "What if they say they're too small?"
✅ "How do we handle 'we have internal IT'?"

---

## What's Next (Phase 2 - Backend Integration)

### Required Components:

1. **Backend API Endpoint**
   - Create `/api/sales-ai/query` route
   - Accept POST requests with `{ question, conversation_history }`
   - Return `{ answer }` JSON response

2. **Knowledge Base Ingestion**
   - Read all `.md` files from `/knowledge-base/`
   - Convert to plain text or structured format
   - Create embeddings using:
     - **Option A:** OpenAI `text-embedding-3-large`
     - **Option B:** Voyage AI `voyage-2`
     - **Option C:** Cohere `embed-english-v3.0`

3. **Vector Database**
   - **Option A:** ChromaDB (local, simple, free)
   - **Option B:** Pinecone (cloud-hosted, scalable)
   - **Option C:** Weaviate (self-hosted, open source)

4. **Claude API Integration**
   - Use Claude 3.5 Sonnet via Anthropic API
   - System prompt: "You are a sales assistant for TotalCareIT..."
   - Include relevant context from vector search
   - Stream responses for better UX

5. **Semantic Search**
   - User asks question → Generate embedding
   - Search vector database for top 3-5 relevant chunks
   - Include chunks in Claude prompt as context
   - Claude generates natural response

### Implementation Steps:

**Step 1: Create Backend API** (2-3 hours)
```python
# api/sales_ai.py
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from anthropic import Anthropic

app = Flask(__name__)
client = Anthropic(api_key=os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"))

@app.route('/api/sales-ai/query', methods=['POST'])
def query():
    data = request.json
    question = data['question']

    # TODO: Search vector database
    context = search_knowledge_base(question)

    # Call Claude with context
    response = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
        max_tokens=1024,
        system=f"You are a sales assistant. Use this context: {context}",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": question}]
    )

    return jsonify({"answer": response.content[0].text})
```

**Step 2: Ingest Knowledge Base** (1-2 hours)
```python
# scripts/ingest_knowledge_base.py
import os
from pathlib import Path
import chromadb

def ingest():
    client = chromadb.Client()
    collection = client.create_collection("sales_kb")

    # Read all markdown files
    kb_path = Path("knowledge-base/sales/general")
    for md_file in kb_path.glob("*.md"):
        with open(md_file) as f:
            content = f.read()

        # Split into chunks (simple version)
        chunks = split_into_chunks(content)

        # Add to vector DB
        collection.add(
            documents=chunks,
            ids=[f"{md_file.stem}_{i}" for i in range(len(chunks))],
            metadatas=[{"source": md_file.name} for _ in chunks]
        )
```

**Step 3: Update Frontend** (30 min)
```javascript
// Change website/js/sales-ai.js
async queryAI(question) {
    const response = await fetch('/api/sales-ai/query', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            question: question,
            conversation_history: this.conversationHistory
        })
    });

    const data = await response.json();
    return data.answer;
}
```

**Step 4: Deploy Backend** (1-2 hours)
- Deploy Flask app to AWS Lambda + API Gateway
- OR: Deploy to EC2 instance
- OR: Deploy to Heroku/Railway/Render
- Add CORS headers for totalcareit.ai domain

**Step 5: Add Authentication** (1 hour)
- Verify user is logged into Partner Portal
- Pass auth token with API requests
- Only allow authenticated partners to use AI

## Testing the Current Implementation

### Manual Testing Steps:

1. **Navigate to Sales Report:**
   ```
   https://totalcareit.ai/partner-login.html
   → Log in
   → Click "Sales Report" in sidebar
   ```

2. **Open Chat:**
   - Look for floating blue/purple gradient button (bottom-right)
   - Click to open chat panel

3. **Test Quick Actions:**
   - Click "Discovery Questions" button
   - Should show 37-question framework

   - Click "Pricing Objections" button
   - Should show LAER framework

   - Click "Service Tiers" button
   - Should show IT Essentials/IT Assist/IT360 comparison

4. **Test Typed Questions:**
   - Type: "What questions should I ask?"
   - Should return discovery questions

   - Type: "How do we handle pricing objections?"
   - Should return LAER framework

   - Type: "What's the difference between IT Assist and IT360?"
   - Should return service tier comparison

5. **Test UI Features:**
   - Type a message → Press Enter (should send)
   - Type a message → Press Shift+Enter (should add new line)
   - Close chat panel → Should collapse
   - Reopen → Chat history should persist
   - Scroll messages → Should have custom scrollbar

### Browser Console Checks:

Open browser console (F12) and look for:
```
🤖 Sales AI loaded
✅ Sales AI initialized
```

If you see these messages, the component loaded successfully.

## Adding Transcripts (For Future)

### How to Add Call Transcripts:

1. **Export from HubSpot/Zoom:**
   - Go to call recording
   - Export transcript as .txt or .docx
   - Save to `/knowledge-base/sales/transcripts/discovery-calls/`

2. **Format:**
   ```
   Filename: 2024-10-29-acme-corp-discovery-call.txt

   Content:
   Rep: Tell me about your role and how IT impacts your day-to-day.
   Prospect: I'm the CEO. IT is a constant headache...
   Rep: What prompted you to reach out to us now?
   Prospect: We just had a ransomware scare...
   [etc.]
   ```

3. **Re-train AI:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/train_sales_ai.py
   ```

### What Makes a Good Transcript:

✅ **DO:**
- Include full conversation
- Label speakers (Rep: / Prospect:)
- Include outcome (deal won/lost, next steps)
- Redact sensitive personal info (SSN, credit cards)

❌ **DON'T:**
- Include competitor client names
- Include proprietary information
- Include personal client details

---

## Success Metrics to Track

Once backend is live, track:

1. **Usage Metrics:**
   - Number of queries per day/week
   - Most common questions asked
   - Average queries per user

2. **Quality Metrics:**
   - User satisfaction (thumbs up/down on responses)
   - Questions that fail to get good answers
   - Response time (should be <2 seconds)

3. **Business Impact:**
   - Close rate before/after Sales AI
   - Time to close deals
   - Sales team feedback

---

## Known Limitations (Current Phase)

1. **Mock Responses Only:** Not true AI - uses keyword matching
2. **No Conversation Memory:** Each question is independent
3. **Limited Context:** Can't answer questions outside predefined topics
4. **No Learning:** Doesn't improve over time
5. **No Transcript Analysis:** Can't learn from actual sales calls

**All of these will be fixed in Phase 2 with Claude API integration.**

---

## Support & Maintenance

### If Chat Doesn't Appear:

1. **Hard refresh browser:** Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. **Clear cache:** Browser settings → Clear cache
3. **Check console:** F12 → Console tab → Look for errors
4. **Verify scripts loaded:** Network tab → Look for `sales-ai.js`

### If Responses Are Wrong:

Currently using mock responses, so:
- Edit `/website/js/sales-ai.js`
- Update `getMockResponse()` function
- Redeploy: `aws s3 cp website/js/sales-ai.js s3://totalcareit.ai/js/sales-ai.js`
- Invalidate cache

### To Update Knowledge Base:

1. Edit markdown files in `/knowledge-base/sales/general/`
2. Update mock responses in `sales-ai.js` to match
3. In Phase 2, just edit markdown - AI will automatically use new content
