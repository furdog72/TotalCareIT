# Autotask API Fix Summary

## Status: ✅ API WORKING - Data Collection Needs Enhancement

### What We Fixed

1. **Environment Loading Issue** ✅
   - Fixed `load_dotenv()` to run BEFORE importing API modules
   - Module-level `os.getenv()` calls were running at import time with empty env
   - Solution: Moved `load_dotenv()` before all imports in [collect_scorecard_week_oct24.py](collect_scorecard_week_oct24.py:17)

2. **Zone URL Configuration** ✅
   - Verified `AUTOTASK_ZONE_URL=https://webservices3.autotask.net` is correctly configured
   - No more 404 errors on zone information endpoint

3. **API Authentication** ✅
   - Username: `gmhad6lqecgcsaq@totalcareit.com`
   - Integration Code: `4AJTYIXNQC6KBJ4VEBDLG6RRAAP`
   - All API calls return 200 OK

### Test Results

✅ **API is fully functional:**
- Companies query: Works
- Tickets query: Works
- Queue information: Works

✅ **Data exists for week Oct 18-24, 2025:**
- **100 tickets** total created in that week
- **97 tickets** in ROC Board queue (ID: 29683483)
- Sample tickets retrieved successfully

### Remaining Issue: Metrics Calculation

The `AutotaskReportingService.get_ticket_metrics()` function returns:
```python
{
    'total': 97,
    'by_status': {...},
    'by_priority': {...},
    'avg_resolution_hours': 24.5,
    'tickets': [...]
}
```

But the collection script expects:
```python
{
    'reactive_tickets_opened': 0,
    'reactive_tickets_closed': 0,
    'same_day_close_pct': 0,
    'utilization_pct': 0,
    'tickets_over_7_days': 0,
    'tickets_per_endpoint': 0,
    'service_noise': 0,  # RHEM
    'avg_response_time_hours': 0,
    'avg_resolution_time_hours': 0,
    'prof_services_opened': 0,
    'prof_services_closed': 0,
    'tickets_over_30_days': 0,
    'tam_questions': 0,
    'tam_tickets_opened': 0,
    'tam_tickets_closed': 0
}
```

### Solution Options

#### Option 1: Enhance `get_ticket_metrics()` Function
Add scorecard-specific calculations to [api/autotask_service.py:279](api/autotask_service.py:279):
- Parse tickets by queue ID (ROC, Prof Services, TAM, Security Alerts)
- Calculate same-day close percentage
- Calculate tickets over 7 days
- Calculate tickets per endpoint
- etc.

#### Option 2: Use Manual Data for Week 4
Since this is just for one week (Oct 24), you can:
1. Manually pull the metrics from Autotask UI
2. Update the scorecard Excel file directly
3. Rebuild the HTML

#### Option 3: Create Simplified Metrics
Map the existing data to scorecard fields:
```python
{
    'reactive_tickets_opened': metrics['total'],  # All tickets
    'reactive_tickets_closed': len([t for t in metrics['tickets'] if t['completedDate']]),
    'avg_resolution_time_hours': metrics['avg_resolution_hours'],
    # Rest remain 0 for now
}
```

### Recommendation

For **quickest results** (Option 2):
1. Log into Autotask PSA
2. Go to ROC Board for Oct 18-24
3. Count: Tickets opened, Tickets closed
4. Manually enter into scorecard Excel
5. Done!

For **long-term automation** (Option 1):
- Enhance the `get_ticket_metrics()` function to calculate all scorecard metrics
- This will require understanding Autotask ticket types, queues, and status codes
- Worth doing if you want weekly automation going forward

## Quick Manual Data Entry

Since the API is working and we have the data, here's what you need to check in Autotask for week Oct 18-24:

### ROC Board (Reactive Operations)
- [ ] Tickets opened
- [ ] Tickets closed
- [ ] Same-day close count
- [ ] Tickets over 7 days old
- [ ] Total endpoints count (for tickets per endpoint)
- [ ] Response time (first response)
- [ ] Resolution time (time to close)

### Professional Services Board
- [ ] Tickets opened
- [ ] Tickets closed
- [ ] Tickets over 30 days old

### TAM Board
- [ ] Questions answered
- [ ] Tickets opened
- [ ] Tickets closed

Once you have these numbers, update the Excel file at:
`/Users/charles/Projects/Reference/Scorecard 2025.xlsx`

Week ending October 24th is the 4th column of October in the spreadsheet.

## Next Steps

1. **Decide**: Manual entry vs. automated calculation?
2. **If manual**: Pull data from Autotask UI and update Excel
3. **If automated**: I can enhance the `get_ticket_metrics()` function with proper calculations

Would you like me to enhance the Autotask service to calculate these metrics automatically?
