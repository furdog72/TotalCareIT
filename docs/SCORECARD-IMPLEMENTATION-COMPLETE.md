# Scorecard Implementation Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented the ROC Board Weekly Scorecard with real data from Autotask.

## What Was Built

### Backend API

**Endpoint**: `/api/scorecard/weekly?week_start=YYYY-MM-DD`

**Features**:
- Accepts week start date (Monday) in YYYY-MM-DD format
- Calculates metrics for Monday-Sunday date range
- Filters tickets to ROC board only (queueID: 29683483)
- Returns comprehensive weekly metrics

**Metrics Calculated**:
1. **Tickets Opened** - Total tickets created in date range
2. **Tickets Closed** - Total tickets completed in date range
3. **Same-Day Closed** - Tickets created and completed on same day
4. **Same-Day Close Rate** - `(same_day_closed / tickets_closed) * 100`
5. **Status** - above_goal (>=70%), near_goal (>=63%), below_goal (<63%)
6. **Gap** - Difference from 70% goal

### Frontend Dashboard

**File**: `website/scorecard.html`

**Features**:
- Clean, responsive card-based layout
- Week selector with date picker
- Quick load buttons for "Last Week" and "This Week"
- Color-coded metrics:
  - Green for above goal
  - Yellow for near goal
  - Red for below goal
- Status badges showing performance vs goal
- Auto-loads last week's data on page load

## Test Results - Last Week (Oct 13-19, 2025)

Successfully tested with real Autotask data:

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "data": {
        "week_start": "2025-10-13",
        "week_end": "2025-10-19",
        "metrics": {
            "tickets_opened": 73,
            "tickets_closed": 70,
            "same_day_closed": 44,
            "same_day_close_rate": 62.9,
            "goal": 70.0,
            "status": "below_goal",
            "gap": -7.1
        },
        "utilization": null
    }
}
```

### Performance Analysis

**Week of October 13-19, 2025**:
- 73 tickets opened in ROC board
- 70 tickets closed (95.9% close rate)
- 44 closed same day (62.9% same-day close rate)
- **7.1% below goal** of 70% same-day close rate

## How to Use

### Access the Dashboard

1. **Start the backend server** (if not running):
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   python -m uvicorn api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
   ```

2. **Open the scorecard**:
   - Local: `file:///Users/charles/Projects/qbo-ai/website/scorecard.html`
   - Or deploy to: `https://totalcareit.ai/scorecard.html`

3. **View data**:
   - Automatically loads last week's data
   - Click "This Week" to see current week
   - Or select any Monday date to view that week

### API Usage

```bash
# Get last week's scorecard
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/scorecard/weekly?week_start=2025-10-13"

# Get this week's scorecard
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/scorecard/weekly?week_start=2025-10-20"

# Get any week (must be a Monday)
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/scorecard/weekly?week_start=2025-10-06"
```

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `website/scorecard.html` - Scorecard dashboard frontend

### Modified Files:
- `api/main.py` - Added `/api/scorecard/weekly` endpoint (lines 371-439)
- `api/autotask_service.py` - Added `get_roc_tickets_for_period()` helper method (lines 315-330)

### Configuration:
- `.env` - Contains `AUTOTASK_ROC_BOARD_ID=29683483`

## Technical Implementation Details

### Same-Day Close Rate Formula

As specified by user: **Option A**

```
Same-Day Close Rate = (same_day_closed / tickets_closed) * 100
```

**Example from last week**:
- 44 same-day closed / 70 tickets closed = 62.9%

### ROC Board Filtering

All queries filter by:
```python
{"field": "queueID", "op": "eq", "value": 29683483}
```

This ensures only reactive operations tickets are included, excluding:
- Sales tickets
- Professional services tickets
- Other queues

### Date Range Calculation

- User provides Monday date (e.g., "2025-10-13")
- System calculates Sunday (Monday + 6 days)
- Queries Autotask for tickets where:
  - `createDate >= week_start`
  - `createDate <= week_end`

### Status Calculation

```python
goal = 70.0

if same_day_rate >= goal:
    status = "above_goal"
elif same_day_rate >= goal * 0.9:  # 63%
    status = "near_goal"
else:
    status = "below_goal"
```

## What's Next

### Immediate Enhancements:

1. **Deploy to Production**:
   - Upload `scorecard.html` to `https://totalcareit.ai/scorecard.html`
   - Update dashboard.html to link to scorecard
   - Deploy backend to `api.totalcareit.ai`

2. **Add Utilization Metric**:
   - Query Autotask time entries
   - Calculate billable hours / total hours
   - Display in dashboard

3. **Quarterly Scorecard**:
   - Create `/api/scorecard/quarterly` endpoint
   - Show Q4 2025 averages
   - Compare to weekly performance

### Future Enhancements:

1. **Historical Data**:
   - Store weekly metrics in database
   - Show trends over time
   - Chart visualization

2. **Export to PDF**:
   - Generate PDF reports
   - Email weekly summaries

3. **Additional Metrics**:
   - Average resolution time
   - First response time
   - Customer satisfaction scores

## Integration with Excel Scorecard

The implementation matches the structure from `Scorecard 2025.xlsx`:

| Excel Column | API Field | Status |
|--------------|-----------|--------|
| Week Start | week_start | ✅ Implemented |
| Reactive Tickets Opened | tickets_opened | ✅ Implemented |
| Reactive Tickets Closed | tickets_closed | ✅ Implemented |
| Same Day Close Rate | same_day_close_rate | ✅ Implemented |
| Utilization | utilization | ⏳ Pending |

## Success Criteria - ACHIEVED

- [x] Backend API endpoint functional
- [x] Real data from Autotask ROC board
- [x] Same-day close rate calculated correctly
- [x] Frontend dashboard created
- [x] Color-coded status indicators
- [x] Week selector working
- [x] Tested with last week's real data
- [x] 70% goal comparison working

## Notes

- Backend server must be running on port 8000 for dashboard to work
- Utilization metric placeholder shown, requires time entries implementation
- Dashboard currently points to localhost:8000 (update for production)
- All dates must be Mondays (enforced by UI validation)
