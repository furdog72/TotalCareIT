# "They Ask You Answer" Recommendations for TotalCareIT.ai

Based on Marcus Sheridan's "They Ask You Answer" principles, here are recommendations for improving the IT Cost Calculator and overall website content strategy.

## Core Principles from the Book

1. **Address the "Big 5" topics customers research:**
   - Pricing & Cost
   - Problems
   - Comparisons (vs. Competitors)
   - Reviews & Best in Class
   - Negative aspects (honest cons)

2. **Be radically transparent** - Answer questions competitors won't
3. **Teach, don't sell** - Educate first, convert later
4. **Make it visual** - Video > Text
5. **Assignment selling** - Prepare prospects before sales calls

## Immediate Recommendations for IT Cost Calculator

### 1. **Expand "What Does IT Cost?" Section**

Current state: Basic calculator with three service tiers

**Recommended additions:**

#### A) Break down into THREE separate cost blocks:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Block 1: MANAGED SERVICES                     │
│  "What you should expect to pay monthly"        │
│  - Per user pricing ($75-$165/user)            │
│  - Per server pricing                          │
│  - Network management                          │
│  Total: Transparent monthly cost               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Block 2: SECURITY & COMPLIANCE                │
│  "Additional costs for enhanced security"       │
│  - Basic security (included in tiers)          │
│  - MSSP add-ons (+$45-$95/user)               │
│  - Compliance requirements (HIPAA, CMMC, etc.) │
│  Total: Security investment                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Block 3: DEVICE as a SERVICE (DaaS)           │
│  "Hardware costs - own vs. lease"              │
│  - Traditional purchase                        │
│  - DaaS monthly cost                           │
│  - Lifecycle comparison                        │
│  Total: Hardware investment                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌═════════════════════════════════════════════════┐
║  GRAND TOTAL: Your Complete IT Budget          ║
║  Monthly: $X,XXX | Annual: $XX,XXX             ║
└═════════════════════════════════════════════════┘
```

#### B) Add "When does it make sense?" section
- **0-10 employees**: IT Essentials typically sufficient
- **10-50 employees**: IT Assist recommended for growth
- **50+ employees or compliance needs**: IT360 required

#### C) Include competitor comparison
"How TotalCareIT Pricing Compares" section:
- National average: $150-$250/user/month
- Florida competitors: $125-$200/user/month
- TotalCareIT: $75-$165/user/month
- Why we can charge less: AI automation, efficient processes

## 3. Calculator Enhancements

### A) **Price Ranges, Not Just Exact Prices**
Instead of: "Your cost: $2,875/month"
Show: "Your estimated cost: $2,500 - $3,200/month"

Explain the range:
- Lower end: No compliance, basic infrastructure
- Higher end: HIPAA compliance, 24/7 monitoring, multiple locations

### B) **"What This Includes" Checklist**
For each tier, show what's INCLUDED vs. ADD-ON:

**IT Essentials ($75/user) includes:**
- ✅ Help desk support (business hours)
- ✅ Patch management
- ✅ Antivirus
- ✅ Basic monitoring
- ❌ 24/7 support (add $15/user)
- ❌ Compliance support (add $25/user)
- ❌ Advanced security (see MSSP calculator)

### C) **ROI Calculator**
"What are you saving compared to in-house IT?"
- Salary comparison: Full-time IT tech salary ($60k-$80k)
- Benefits & overhead (30%): $18k-$24k
- Training & certifications: $5k-$10k/year
- Tools & software: $10k-$15k/year
- **Total in-house cost: $93k-$129k/year**
- **Outsourced MSP cost for 25 users: $22.5k-$49.5k/year**
- **Potential savings: $43.5k-$79.5k/year**

### D) **Industry-Specific Examples**
Add dropdown: "What industry are you in?"
- Healthcare → Emphasize HIPAA compliance costs
- Legal → Emphasize data security and compliance
- Manufacturing → Emphasize uptime and remote monitoring
- Retail → Emphasize PCI-DSS compliance

## 4. Video Content Strategy

Marcus emphasizes VIDEO as the #1 content type. Create:

### **Calculator Video Series:**
1. "Walking Through the IT Cost Calculator" (3-5 min)
2. "What Should IT Really Cost Your Business?" (8-10 min)
3. "Hidden IT Costs You're Probably Paying" (5-7 min)
4. "Managed Services vs. In-House IT: Real Math" (10-12 min)

### **Assignment Videos** (pre-qualify leads):
Before sales calls, send prospects:
1. "5 Questions to Ask Any MSP Before Signing" (5 min)
2. "Red Flags: When an MSP Quote Is Too Good to Be True" (6 min)
3. "Preparing for Your IT Assessment Meeting" (4 min)

---

## 5. Homepage Changes

### Add "Pricing" to Main Navigation
Don't hide pricing! Make it prominent:
- Home | Services | **Pricing** | Calculators | Resources | Contact

### Create Dedicated Pricing Page
Path: `/pricing` or `/what-does-it-cost`

Content structure:
1. **Hero**: "Transparent Pricing. No Surprises."
2. **Three Service Tiers** (visual cards)
3. **What's NOT Included** (be honest)
4. **Calculator** (embedded)
5. **Case Studies** (real client examples with costs)
6. **FAQ** (price-related questions)
7. **CTA**: "Get Your Custom Quote"

---

## 6. Trust-Building Content

### Add "Honest Content" Section
Create a `/resources` page with:
- "Should You Hire Us?" quiz
- "Reasons NOT to Choose TotalCareIT"
- "Our Biggest Mistakes (And What We Learned)"
- "Client Reviews: The Good and The Bad"

### Add Client Stories with REAL Numbers
Instead of: "We helped a client save money"
Write: "How XYZ Company reduced IT costs from $8,500/month to $4,200/month"

Include:
- Company size & industry
- Previous setup
- Problems they faced
- Exact cost before/after
- Time to ROI
- Honest challenges during transition

## 7. Technical Implementation

### Three-Block Calculator Layout (HTML Structure)
```html
<div class="cost-blocks">
    <!-- Block 1: Managed Services -->
    <div class="cost-block">
        <h3>🖥️ Managed Services</h3>
        <p>Monthly IT support & infrastructure management</p>
        <div class="cost-inputs">...</div>
        <div class="cost-result">
            <span class="block-total">$X,XXX/mo</span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Block 2: Security & Compliance -->
    <div class="cost-block">
        <h3>🔒 Security & Compliance</h3>
        <p>Enhanced protection & regulatory requirements</p>
        <div class="cost-inputs">...</div>
        <div class="cost-result">
            <span class="block-total">$X,XXX/mo</span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Block 3: Device as a Service -->
    <div class="cost-block">
        <h3>💻 Hardware (DaaS)</h3>
        <p>Device lifecycle management vs. traditional purchase</p>
        <div class="cost-inputs">...</div>
        <div class="cost-result">
            <span class="block-total">$X,XXX/mo</span>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<!-- Grand Total -->
<div class="grand-total">
    <h2>Your Complete IT Budget</h2>
    <div class="total-monthly">$X,XXX per month</div>
    <div class="total-annual">$XX,XXX per year</div>
    <p>Compared to in-house: Save $XX,XXX/year</p>
</div>
```

## 8. Call-to-Action Strategy

### Replace generic CTAs with specific ones:

**Instead of:** "Get Started"
**Use:** "See Your Custom IT Budget" or "Calculate Your Actual Cost"

**Instead of:** "Contact Us"
**Use:** "Schedule a No-Pressure IT Assessment"

**Instead of:** "Learn More"
**Use:** "See Real Client Costs & Results"

## 9. SEO & AI Search Optimization

Following "They Ask You Answer," create content around actual search queries:

### Long-tail Keywords to Target:
- "how much should I pay for IT support"
- "MSP pricing per user 2025"
- "managed services cost calculator"
- "in house IT vs outsourced cost"
- "what does HIPAA compliance IT cost"
- "small business IT budget calculator"
- "managed services too expensive"

### Schema Markup
Add FAQ schema for common pricing questions:
```json
{
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How much should I pay for managed IT services?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Most businesses pay between $75-$250 per user per month..."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
