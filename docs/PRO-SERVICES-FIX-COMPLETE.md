# Pro Services Investigation - RESOLVED

## Summary

Successfully identified and fixed the Pro Services tracking issue. The problem was twofold:
1. **Wrong Queue ID** - Was using 29683482 (Security Alerts) instead of 29683485 (Actual Pro Services)
2. **Wrong Date Field** - Was tracking by createDate instead of completedDate

## Root Cause

### Issue 1: Incorrect Queue Assignment

**What we thought**: Queue 29683482 = Pro Services
**Reality**:
- Queue **29683482** = Security Alerts (Blackpoint, SaaS monitoring, backup alerts)
- Queue **29683485** = Actual Pro Services (manual project work)

### Issue 2: Wrong Tracking Metric

Pro Services work is project-based, so tickets can be:
- Created weeks/months before completion
- Worked on over extended periods
- Should be tracked by **completion date**, not creation date

**Example from your screenshot**:
- T20251007.0169 "Enterprise Application Approval in Azure"
- Created: Oct 7, 2025
- Completed: Oct 13, 2025
- **Should count toward Oct 13-19 week** (when completed)

## The Fix

### 1. Corrected Queue IDs in [.env](.env)

```bash
# Before
AUTOTASK_PRO_SERVICES_ID=29683482  # WRONG - This was security alerts

# After
AUTOTASK_PRO_SERVICES_ID=29683485  # CORRECT - Real Pro Services queue
AUTOTASK_SECURITY_ALERTS_ID=29683482  # Documented for reference
```

### 2. Updated Query Logic in [api/main.py](api/main.py)

**Before** (lines 421-428):
```python
# Queried by createDate
pro_services_tickets = client.get_tickets_by_queue(
    int(client.PRO_SERVICES_QUEUE_ID),
    start_date,
    end_date
)
```

**After** (lines 421-434):
```python
# Query by completedDate for project-based work
filters = {
    'filter': [
        {'field': 'queueID', 'op': 'eq', 'value': int(client.PRO_SERVICES_QUEUE_ID)},
        {'field': 'completedDate', 'op': 'gte', 'value': start_date.isoformat()},
        {'field': 'completedDate', 'op': 'lte', 'value': end_date.isoformat()}
    ],
    'MaxRecords': 500
}
result = client.query('/Tickets/query', filters)
pro_services_tickets = result.get('items', [])
```

### 3. Updated Response Format

**Before**:
```json
"pro_services": {
    "tickets_opened": 500,  // Wrong queue + wrong metric
    "tickets_closed": 0
}
```

**After**:
```json
"pro_services": {
    "tickets_completed": 4  // Correct: Projects completed this week
}
```

### 4. Updated Dashboard HTML

Changed from "opened/closed" to "completed" metric:

```html
<!-- Before -->
<div class="metric-detail"><span id="proServicesClosed">-</span> closed this week</div>

<!-- After -->
<div class="metric-detail">Projects completed this week</div>
```

## Verification

### Test Results - Oct 13-19, 2025

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/scorecard/weekly?week_start=2025-10-13"
```

**Response**:
```json
{
    "pro_services": {
        "tickets_completed": 4
    }
}
```

### Verified Tickets

The 4 completed Pro Services projects during Oct 13-19:

1. **T20250929.0012** - "Outlining Support Roles and Responsibilities"
   - Created: Sep 29
   - Completed: Oct 15

2. **T20250929.0080** - "New Laptop Build"
   - Created: Sep 29
   - Completed: Oct 13

3. **T20251001.0133** - "Create new SharePoint Site"
   - Created: Oct 1
   - Completed: Oct 14

4. **T20251007.0169** - "Enterprise Application Approval in Azure" *(from your screenshot)*
   - Created: Oct 7
   - Completed: Oct 13

All 4 tickets are from queue **29683485** and have completedDate within the Oct 13-19 range.

## Final Queue Mapping

| Queue ID | Queue Name | Ticket Volume | Usage |
|----------|------------|---------------|-------|
| 29683483 | ROC Board | ~70/week | ✅ Tracked weekly (createDate) |
| 29683485 | Pro Services | ~4/week | ✅ Tracked weekly (completedDate) |
| 29683490 | TAM | ~15/week | ✅ Tracked weekly (createDate) |
| 29683479 | Sales | 246 open | ✅ Tracked all-time (open only) |
| 29683482 | Security Alerts | 500+/week | ❌ Not tracked (automated alerts) |
| 29683484 | Monitoring Alerts | 500+/week | ❌ Not tracked (automated alerts) |

## Files Modified

1. **/.env** - Updated AUTOTASK_PRO_SERVICES_ID from 29683482 to 29683485
2. **/api/main.py** - Changed Pro Services query to use completedDate filter
3. **/website/scorecard.html** - Updated UI to show "completed" instead of "opened/closed"

## Why This Makes Sense

### Pro Services vs ROC Board

**ROC Board** (Reactive Operations):
- Short-lived tickets (same-day close goal)
- Opened and closed within days
- Track by createDate makes sense

**Pro Services** (Projects):
- Long-lived tickets (weeks/months)
- Opened when project starts
- Closed when project finishes
- Track by completedDate makes sense (when revenue is recognized)

### Business Metrics Impact

**Old (Wrong) Data**:
- 500 opened, 0 closed
- Made it appear Pro Services had massive backlog
- Couldn't track project completion rate

**New (Correct) Data**:
- 4 projects completed
- Accurately reflects Pro Services delivery
- Can track weekly project completion trends

## Next Steps

### Recommended Improvements

1. **Add Project Count Metric**
   - Currently open Pro Services projects
   - Shows current workload

2. **Add Revenue Tracking**
   - Link completed tickets to billable amounts
   - Calculate weekly Pro Services revenue

3. **Separate Alerts Queue**
   - Create dedicated "Security Alerts" queue in Autotask
   - Move automated alerts out of Pro Services
   - Keeps Pro Services queue clean

4. **Track Project Duration**
   - Calculate average time from createDate to completedDate
   - Identify long-running projects
   - Optimize project delivery time

## Status

✅ **ISSUE RESOLVED**

- Pro Services now showing accurate data (4 completed for Oct 13-19)
- Dashboard updated to display correctly
- API endpoint fixed and tested
- Queue IDs verified and documented

**Investigation Date**: October 24, 2025
**Root Cause**: Wrong queue ID (29683482 vs 29683485) + Wrong date field (createDate vs completedDate)
**Resolution**: Updated .env, api/main.py, and scorecard.html
**Status**: ✅ FIXED AND TESTED
