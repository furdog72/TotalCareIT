## Positioning Tips for Sales Conversations

### When to recommend IT Essentials:
- "It sounds like you're looking for reliable support without all the bells and whistles. IT Essentials gives you solid fundamentals - help desk, patching, antivirus - at a price point that works for smaller teams."

### When to recommend IT Assist (MOST COMMON):
- "Based on what you've told me about [cybersecurity concerns / multiple locations / growth plans], I'd recommend starting with IT Assist. It's our most popular tier because it hits the sweet spot - you get 24/7 monitoring and advanced security without paying for enterprise features you don't need yet."

### When to recommend IT360:
- "Given your compliance requirements [HIPAA/CMMC/PCI], IT360 is really the only option that makes sense. The compliance programs alone would cost more than the tier upgrade if you purchased them separately."

## Handling "What's the difference?" Questions

**Question:** "What's the main difference between IT Assist and IT360?"

**Answer:** "The big difference is compliance and strategic planning. IT Assist gives you excellent day-to-day support and security, but IT360 adds the compliance programs (HIPAA, CMMC, etc.) and a dedicated vCIO who acts like your part-time CIO. If you're in a regulated industry or need help planning your technology strategy, IT360 is worth it. If you just need rock-solid support and security, IT Assist is the sweet spot."

**Question:** "Can we start with IT Essentials and upgrade later?"

**Answer:** "Absolutely! Many clients start with IT Essentials to get their feet wet, then upgrade to IT Assist once they see the value and want the enhanced security and 24/7 monitoring. There's no penalty for upgrading, and we can do it anytime."

## Pricing Objections Reference

### "You're more expensive than [competitor]"

**Response Framework:**
1. **Acknowledge:** "I appreciate you being upfront about that. Price is definitely a factor."

2. **Clarify scope:** "Help me understand - what's included in their quote? Are they offering 24/7 monitoring or just business hours?"

3. **Common differences:**
   - Our pricing includes 24/7 monitoring, not just 9-5
   - We include security tools (EDR, MFA, email security) - others charge extra
   - We're proactive, not reactive - we prevent fires, not just put them out
   - Our response times are contractual SLAs, not "best effort"

4. **Total Cost of Ownership:** "Let me ask - what's an hour of downtime worth to your business? Most of our clients calculate [X amount]. We reduce incidents by 60% in the first 6 months. That's [Y hours saved] which is worth [Z dollars]."

5. **Case study:** "Let me share - we had a client switch from [competitor] who was $15/user cheaper. After 6 months with us, they calculated they were saving $3,000/month in reduced downtime and eliminated IT frustration. The net savings was actually $1,500/month after our higher fee."

### "We need to think about it"

**Response:**
- "Of course! What specifically would you like to think about? Is it the pricing, the service tier, or something else?"
- "Is there anything holding you back that I haven't addressed?"
- "What would need to happen for this to be a clear yes for you?"

### "We're happy with our current provider"

**Response:**
- "That's great to hear! What do you like most about them?"
- [Listen, then ask] "If you could wave a magic wand and improve one thing about your IT support, what would it be?"
- "I'm curious - what prompted you to take this call if you're happy?"
