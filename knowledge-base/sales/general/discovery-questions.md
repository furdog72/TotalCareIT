## Budget Discovery (Handle Carefully)

### Approach 1: Current Spend

21. **"What are you currently spending on IT per month?"**

22. **"If you have in-house IT staff, what does that fully loaded cost look like?"**
    - Salary + benefits + taxes = usually $80K-$120K for mid-level
    - That's $6,600-$10,000/month vs our services

### Approach 2: Value-Based

23. **"What's an hour of downtime worth to your business?"**
    - Manufacturing: $10K-$50K/hour
    - Professional services: $2K-$10K/hour
    - Retail: Varies by revenue
    - Calculate ROI: "We reduce downtime by 60%, that's [X] savings"

24. **"Have you calculated the cost of a data breach or ransomware attack?"**

## Example Flow for a Good Discovery Call

**Prospect:** Healthcare clinic, 45 employees, using break-fix currently

**You:** "Tell me about your role and how IT impacts your day-to-day work"

**Prospect:** "I'm the Office Manager. IT is a constant headache. When something breaks, our front desk can't check patients in, and it can take hours to get help."

**You:** "That sounds really frustrating, especially in a patient-care environment. What prompted you to reach out to us now?"

**Prospect:** "Our break-fix guy retired, and we're realizing we don't have a backup plan. Plus, we just got cyber insurance and they're requiring MFA and better security, which we don't have."

**You:** "Got it - so you're dealing with both a support gap and compliance requirements. Let me ask - do you have any specific compliance needs being a healthcare clinic? HIPAA?"

**Prospect:** "Yes, we need to be HIPAA compliant. We had an audit last year and barely passed. The auditor said our IT security was 'concerning.'"

**You:** "That must have been stressful. Are you confident in your current security setup?"

**Prospect:** "Honestly, no. We don't even know what we have. Our break-fix guy set things up years ago."

[Continue with infrastructure questions, then move to pricing...]

**You:** "Based on what you've shared - 45 employees, HIPAA compliance, need for proactive support and better security - I'd recommend our IT360 tier. It includes everything you need: 24/7 monitoring, advanced security, help desk, and full HIPAA compliance support with a dedicated vCIO. For 45 users, that would be around $7,400/month. How does that compare to what you're spending now?"

**Prospect:** "We're spending about $2,000/month with our break-fix guy, but that doesn't include security tools or compliance work, which we're paying for separately... actually, it's probably closer to $4,500 total."

**You:** "So you're at $4,500 without 24/7 support, without proactive monitoring, and you barely passed your last audit. For $2,900 more per month, you get comprehensive coverage, HIPAA compliance management, and peace of mind. What's an hour of downtime worth when your front desk can't check patients in?"

**Prospect:** "Honestly, probably $1,000-$2,000/hour in lost revenue plus patient dissatisfaction."

**You:** "If we can reduce your downtime by just 2-3 hours per month - which is conservative based on our other healthcare clients - the service pays for itself. Does that make sense?"

**Prospect:** "Yes, when you put it that way..."

**You:** "Great! What concerns do you have at this point?"
