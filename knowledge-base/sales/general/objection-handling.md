# Objection Handling Guide

## The LAER Framework

Use this for ALL objections:
1. **L**isten - Let them fully explain
2. **A**cknowledge - Validate their concern
3. **E**xplore - Ask questions to understand the real objection
4. **R**espond - Address with confidence

---

## Pricing Objections

### "You're more expensive than [competitor]"

**Listen:** Let them tell you the price difference

**Acknowledge:** "I appreciate you being upfront about the numbers."

**Explore:**
- "Help me understand - what's included in their quote?"
- "Are they offering 24/7 monitoring or just business hours?"
- "What security tools are included?"
- "What are their response time SLAs?"

**Respond:**

**Compare apples to apples:**
"I want to make sure we're comparing the same services. Our pricing includes:
- 24/7 network monitoring and alerting
- Advanced security suite (EDR, MFA, email security, web filtering)
- Unlimited help desk support
- Proactive patch management
- Quarterly business reviews
- [Add compliance if IT360]

Many competitors charge extra for these, or only offer them as add-ons."

**Focus on Total Cost of Ownership:**
"Let me ask you this - what's an hour of downtime worth to your business?"

[Let them answer - usually $1K-$10K+]

"Our clients see a 60% reduction in IT incidents in the first 6 months. If you're currently experiencing [X incidents/month] at [Y hours each], that's [Z hours saved] per month. At [their downtime cost], that's [savings amount]. The service effectively pays for itself through reduced downtime alone."

**Share a case study:**
"I had a client in [similar industry] who switched from [competitor name] who was $20/user cheaper. Within 3 months, they calculated they were saving $5,000/month in reduced downtime and eliminated IT frustration. The net savings after our higher fee was $3,500/month. Would you like me to connect you with them?"

**Bottom line:**
"The question isn't 'What's the monthly fee?' but rather 'What's the total cost including downtime, security risks, and productivity loss?' We're typically more expensive per user but less expensive in total cost."

---

### "That's more than we budgeted"

**Acknowledge:** "I understand budget constraints are real. Nobody has unlimited funds."

**Explore:**
- "What were you budgeting for?"
- "What's driving that budget number?" (Often based on outdated info)
- "What happens if we can't make the budget work? Do you continue as-is?"

**Respond:**

**Option 1 - Start smaller:**
"Would it make sense to start with our IT Essentials tier at $75/user? You'd get core support, and we can upgrade to IT Assist when budget allows."

**Option 2 - Phase in services:**
"We could start with just your critical servers and key employees (executives, finance, etc.), then add the rest of your team over the next quarter as budget allows."

**Option 3 - Find budget:**
"Let's look at what you're currently spending:
- Current IT person or break-fix: $___
- Software licenses we'd include: $___
- Security tools we'd provide: $___
- Time your team spends dealing with IT: $___

When you add it all up, companies are usually already spending 80-90% of our fee - they just don't realize it because it's scattered across multiple line items."

**Option 4 - ROI approach:**
"What if we could show you'll actually save money overall? Between reduced downtime, eliminated security risks, and reclaimed productivity, most clients see a positive ROI within 6 months. Can we look at the numbers together?"

---

### "We can't afford a monthly contract"

**Acknowledge:** "I understand the concern about recurring costs."

**Explore:**
- "What's your current IT spend per month?" (They're already spending, just reactively)
- "Have you calculated what IT issues cost you per month in downtime and lost productivity?"

**Respond:**

"Let me share why the monthly contract actually saves you money:

**Break-fix model:**
- Something breaks → you call → we come out → you pay hourly
- No incentive for us to prevent issues (we make more when things break)
- Unpredictable costs - one bad month could be $10K in emergency fixes
- No proactive monitoring - issues get worse before they're found

**Monthly managed services:**
- Fixed, predictable monthly cost
- We're incentivized to PREVENT problems (costs us money when things break)
- 24/7 monitoring catches issues before they impact you
- Proactive maintenance prevents most emergencies
- Unlimited support - no surprise bills

Most clients spend LESS on managed services than they did on break-fix because emergencies become rare."

**Case study:**
"I have a client who was spending $2,000-$8,000/month on break-fix - wildly unpredictable. They now pay $4,500/month with us and haven't had a major incident in 18 months. They went from unpredictable reactive costs to predictable proactive support."

---

## Competitor Objections

### "We're already talking to [competitor]"

**Acknowledge:** "That's great! I'm glad you're doing your due diligence."

**Explore:**
- "What do you like about them so far?"
- "What questions do you still have?"
- "What criteria are you using to make your decision?"

**Respond:**

"I respect that you're evaluating multiple options. Let me share what makes us different:

**[If competitor is a large national MSP like CompuCom, Insight]:**
'We're a local MSP, which means you'll work with a dedicated team who knows your business, not a rotating cast of technicians reading notes. Our average client relationship is 7+ years because we become part of their team.'

**[If competitor is a smaller local MSP]:**
'Both of us are local, which is great. The differentiators for us are [specific: our compliance expertise, our 24/7 NOC, our vCIO program, our industry specialization].'

**[If competitor is a friend/nephew/internal IT person]:**
'I'm sure they're talented, but ask yourself: What happens when they're on vacation? When they're sick? When they get hit by a bus? With us, you have a team of 15+ engineers with deep expertise in different areas - networking, security, cloud, compliance. You get redundancy and specialization.'

Don't badmouth competitors. Be professional and confident. Focus on your unique value."

---

### "Our current provider is fine"

**Acknowledge:** "I'm genuinely glad to hear you have a good relationship with them."

**Explore (critical questions):**
- "What do you like most about them?"
- [After they answer] "If you could wave a magic wand and improve ONE thing about your IT support, what would it be?"
- "Out of curiosity, what prompted you to take this call if things are going well?"

**Respond:**

There's ALWAYS a reason they're talking to you. Find it. Common hidden issues:
- Response times are slow
- They lack specific expertise (security, compliance, cloud)
- They're worried about the provider's stability
- Pricing has been creeping up
- They had an incident and lost confidence

Once you identify the real issue:
"It sounds like [current provider] is doing well with [what they like], but you're looking for [what they want improved]. That's exactly where we excel. Let me show you how we handle [their concern]..."

---

## Trust & Risk Objections

### "We need to think about it"

**Acknowledge:** "Of course! This is an important decision."

**Explore (most important):**
- "What specifically would you like to think about?"
- "Is it the pricing, the service tier, the contract terms, or something else?"
- "What questions do you still have that I haven't answered?"

**Respond:**

This objection is usually one of three things:
1. **Price** - They need budget approval or want to negotiate
2. **Trust** - They don't trust you/your company yet
3. **Polite brush-off** - They're not interested but too polite to say so

**Address each:**

**If it's price:**
"I understand. Would it help if I showed you a payment schedule or phased approach to spread the investment?"

**If it's trust:**
"I get it - you're trusting us with your entire IT infrastructure. What would help you feel more confident? References from similar clients? A trial period? Meeting our team?"

**If it's a brush-off:**
"I appreciate your candor. Let me ask directly - is this something you're seriously considering, or are you just gathering information for now? I don't want to waste your time."

---

### "We need references"

**Acknowledge:** "Absolutely! I'd be concerned if you didn't ask."

**Respond:**

"I can provide references from clients in [similar industry/size]. Who would be most relevant for you to talk to?
- A client in your industry? [healthcare, manufacturing, finance]
- A client of similar size? [~X employees]
- A client who switched from [their current situation]?

I'll email you contact info for 3 clients who've agreed to be references, and you can call them directly. I'll also send you some case studies and our client testimonials page.

Is there anything specific you'd like them to address? Their onboarding experience? Responsiveness? Security? Compliance?"

**Follow up with:**
- 3 relevant reference contacts (get permission first!)
- Link to case studies
- Link to testimonials page
- Google/Clutch reviews if you have them

---

### "What if we're not happy?"

**Acknowledge:** "That's a fair concern. You're making a significant investment."

**Respond:**

"Here's how we handle that:

1. **30-day onboarding period**: We have weekly check-ins to ensure everything is running smoothly. If there are issues, we address them immediately.

2. **Quarterly business reviews**: We review service metrics, your satisfaction, and upcoming needs. This catches any issues before they become problems.

3. **Contract terms**: [State your actual terms - common is 30-60 day out with notice]. If we're not meeting expectations and can't resolve the issues, you can terminate with [X] days notice.

4. **Our track record**: Our average client relationship is [X] years. We have a [Y%] retention rate. Clients stay because we deliver on our promises.

The real question is: How can we make sure you ARE happy? What does success look like to you?"

---

## Timing Objections

### "We're not ready to make a change right now"

**Acknowledge:** "I understand. Change is disruptive, especially when it comes to something as critical as IT."

**Explore:**
- "What would need to happen for you to be ready?"
- "Is it timing, budget, internal processes, or something else?"
- "When do you think you'd be ready to make a change?"

**Respond:**

**If timing is due to contract:**
"When does your current contract end? Let's schedule time in [month before contract ends] to review your options. That gives us time to plan a smooth transition. In the meantime, I'll send you our monthly newsletter so you can see the kind of thought leadership and insights we provide to clients."

**If timing is due to other priorities:**
"I get it - you've got a lot on your plate. The irony is that great IT support actually frees up your time by eliminating IT headaches. But let's do this: What if we stay in touch monthly just to share industry insights and answer any questions? No pressure to buy - just valuable information. When the timing is right, you'll already know us."

**If timing is due to fear of disruption:**
"I understand the concern about disruption. Let me walk you through our onboarding process - we've refined it over [X] years to be as seamless as possible. Most clients are surprised at how smooth the transition is. We typically schedule it over a weekend or after-hours to minimize any impact. Would that address your concern?"

---

### "We're in the middle of [other project]"

**Acknowledge:** "That makes sense. You don't want to juggle too many changes at once."

**Explore:**
- "When do you expect that project to wrap up?"
- "Would it help or hurt that project to have better IT support?"

**Respond:**

**Option 1 - Support the project:**
"Actually, having strong IT support during your [project] could be really valuable. We've helped clients with [office moves / cloud migrations / software implementations] and can ensure the IT side goes smoothly. Would it make sense to start now so we can support that initiative?"

**Option 2 - Schedule future:**
"That's fine. Let's put something on the calendar for [month after project ends]. I'll check in with you then, and if the timing is right, we can move forward."

---

## Authority Objections

### "I need to discuss this with [other decision maker]"

**Acknowledge:** "Of course! This is definitely a decision that needs buy-in from [CEO/CFO/Board]."

**Explore:**
- "Who else needs to be involved?"
- "What concerns do you think they'll have?"
- "Would it make sense for me to present to them directly?"

**Respond:**

**Option 1 - Executive presentation:**
"I'm happy to present to your [CEO/CFO/leadership team] directly. I can tailor the presentation to focus on what matters most to them - ROI, risk mitigation, strategic alignment. Would a 30-minute call work?"

**Option 2 - Provide materials:**
"What information would be most helpful for you to share with them? I can provide:
- Executive summary (1-page overview)
- ROI calculator showing cost savings
- Security risk assessment
- Case studies from similar companies
- References

What would be most compelling for [decision maker]?"

**Option 3 - Understand their concerns:**
"What do you think [decision maker]'s biggest concern will be? Price? Disruption? Trust? Let's address that proactively in the materials we provide."

---

## Technical Objections

### "We have an internal IT person"

**Acknowledge:** "That's great! Having in-house IT expertise is valuable."

**Explore:**
- "How many people are on your IT team?"
- "What do they focus on day-to-day?"
- "What happens when they're on vacation or sick?"
- "Do they have expertise in [security/compliance/cloud]?"

**Respond:**

"We're not looking to replace your IT person - we're looking to support them. Think of us as their extended team. Here's how it typically works:

**Your IT person focuses on:**
- Strategic projects
- Business systems (ERP, CRM)
- End-user training
- Vendor management

**We handle:**
- 24/7 monitoring and alerting
- After-hours support
- Specialized expertise (security, compliance, cloud)
- Backup when they're out
- Second-level escalation for complex issues

Your IT person becomes more strategic instead of constantly firefighting. Plus, they get the benefit of our 15+ engineers' collective knowledge.

Many of our clients have internal IT teams who love working with us because it makes their job easier and their career more rewarding."

**Alternatively (if budget is the concern):**
"Let's look at the math. Your IT person costs approximately:
- Salary: $___
- Benefits (30%): $___
- Taxes: $___
- Training/certs: $___
- **Total: $XX,XXX/month for ONE person**

For that same budget (or often less), you get a TEAM of specialized engineers covering:
- Help desk
- Network engineering
- Security expertise
- Compliance specialists
- 24/7 coverage

Plus, no vacation gaps, no sick days, no hiring if they leave."

---

### "We're moving to the cloud - do we still need you?"

**Acknowledge:** "Great question. The cloud is definitely part of a modern IT strategy."

**Respond:**

"Actually, moving to the cloud makes IT support MORE important, not less. Here's why:

**What the cloud does:**
- Removes physical infrastructure
- Provides scalability
- Offers redundancy

**What the cloud does NOT do:**
- Manage your users (Who sets up Office 365 accounts? Who handles password resets?)
- Configure security (Azure/AWS are secure, but YOU have to configure them correctly)
- Monitor for threats (Cloud providers monitor THEIR infrastructure, not YOUR data)
- Integrate systems (How do your cloud apps talk to each other?)
- Handle end-user support (Who helps when email doesn't work?)

We specialize in cloud management:
- Office 365 administration
- Azure/AWS architecture and optimization
- Cloud security (conditional access, MFA, DLP)
- Cloud backup (yes, you need to backup Office 365)
- Cost optimization (cloud bills can spiral out of control)

The cloud is a tool, but you still need someone who knows how to use it effectively. That's where we come in."

---

## Industry-Specific Objections

### "We're too small for managed services"

**Acknowledge:** "I hear that a lot from companies your size."

**Respond:**

"Actually, small businesses benefit MORE from managed services than large companies. Here's why:

**Large companies:**
- Can afford in-house IT teams
- Can absorb occasional downtime
- Have resources to recover from security incidents

**Small businesses:**
- Can't afford full-time IT staff (that's $100K+)
- ONE security incident can put you out of business
- Downtime hits harder - you don't have the revenue cushion

Our IT Essentials tier was designed specifically for companies your size - 5-25 employees who need reliable IT support without enterprise pricing. At $75/user for [X] employees, that's $[Y]/month. Can you hire a qualified IT person for that? Can you afford NOT to have IT support when something breaks?"

---

### "Our industry is different - you won't understand it"

**Acknowledge:** "You're absolutely right that every industry has unique needs."

**Explore:**
- "What makes your industry unique from an IT perspective?"
- "What concerns do you have about us not understanding [industry]?"

**Respond:**

**If you HAVE experience in their industry:**
"Actually, we work with several [industry] clients. For example, [Client A] is a [similar company] with [similar challenges]. We've helped them with [specific solutions]. I'd be happy to connect you with them as a reference."

**If you DON'T have experience in their industry:**
"You're right - we don't have deep experience in [industry] specifically. But here's what we DO have:
- Expertise in IT fundamentals (security, networking, support) that apply across all industries
- Experience in [related industry] which has similar challenges
- A proven process for learning your business and industry requirements
- The humility to ask questions and learn

What we've found is that industry knowledge is learnable, but IT expertise takes years to build. We have the IT expertise and are committed to learning your industry. Does that approach work for you?"

---

## Closing Techniques After Handling Objections

### The Direct Close
"So if we can address [objection], are you ready to move forward?"

### The Alternative Close
"Would you like to start with IT Assist or IT360?"

### The Timeline Close
"If we move forward today, we can have you onboarded by [date]. Does that timeline work for you?"

### The Risk Reversal Close
"Let's do this: We'll start with a 30-day trial period. If you're not seeing value, we'll part ways with no hard feelings. If you ARE seeing value, we'll continue. Fair enough?"

---

## When to Walk Away

Not every prospect is a good fit. Walk away if:

1. **Abusive or disrespectful** - Life's too short
2. **Unrealistic expectations** - "We need 24/7 support for $25/user"
3. **Budget won't work** - If they can only afford $30/user and won't budge
4. **Wrong fit** - Highly mobile workforce, very small (<5 users), etc.
5. **Unethical business practices** - Red flags about the company itself
6. **Shopping on price alone** - "Who's the cheapest?" with no regard for value

**How to walk away professionally:**
"I appreciate you considering us, but I don't think we're the right fit for your needs. [Explain briefly]. I'd recommend looking at [alternative solution if applicable]. I wish you the best of luck."

Walking away from bad fits protects your company and your sanity.
